### This folder contains a bootstrap template and a blank angular cli project
1. template: contains the bootstrap template
2. web contains the angular project

You will need to install a few things to begin with:

1. NodeJS and NPM
2. Angular CLI: 
* npm install -g @angular/cli
* cd web
* npm install
* ng serve

This would download all required dependencies and serve the template project ready to be edited.

### Objective:
Convert the template to an angular app, use angular components to break down a page into reusable components, eg. header, footer, menus, contact-form etc.
